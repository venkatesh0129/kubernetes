Scaling: adding the number of pods in the cluster
Descaling: deleting the number of pods in the cluster
In Docker swarm there is no scaling and Descaling Concept
In Docker swarm there is no Container load balancing Concept.

1. Can u please explain kubernetes Architecture?
Ans: 
in k8s there are two components: master and worker nodes
Each worker node can be traeted as on environment(EX: dev/QA/PROD)
Connecting the Worker nodes to the master node is known as Kubernetes cluster setup

==> In order to setup kubernetes cluster 
    we should install Docker in Master node as well as worker node
==> There are different components in Master node as well as worker node.

		*Worker Node*
==> Components in Worker Node: Pods, Docker, Kubelet, Kube-proxy

1. 		**Pods**
==>	 Group of containers is called a Pod.
==> But this is not recommended way, in real time we use one container in one pod.
==>  In Docker generally,we use one instance to create number of containers 
     and provide number of applications to end user.
==>
*master Node*
> Components in Master Node: API Server, Scheduler, Controller-Manager, etcd
> When ever we setup kubernetes cluster, by default in kubernetes master,
  there will be API Server, Scheduler, Controller-Manager, etcd.
